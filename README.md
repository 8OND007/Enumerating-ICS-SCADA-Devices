# Enumerating-ICS-SCADA-Devices
This is a repository dedicated to discovering and enumerating industrial control and SCADA devices. Utilizing open-source tools, I have compiled scans and scripts for targeting Operational Technology (OT) devices and hosts! 

To get an overview of the availability of ICS devices in todayâ€™s networks, we selected the most represented protocols and probed the entire IPv4 address space to identify how many of those systems were actually openly reachable.

  - BACnet (Building Automation and Control network) is a communication protocol used by building automation and control systems
  - Fox is a communication protocols most commonly used in building automation systems
  - Modbus is a communication protocol used by programmable logic controllers (PLC)

In 2017, researchers scanned the internet for these devices, and here the number of devices they found utilzing each protocol:
  - Fox: 27k
  - Modbus: 23k
  - Bacnet: 16k

I wanted to publish this repository to aid in network professionals looking to secure ICS device, but WARNING, these scans have the ability to take down ICS devices! BE CAREFUL!

I have included an infographic on the MITRE Att&ck for ICS for anyone looking to understand ICS/SCADA exploitation:
